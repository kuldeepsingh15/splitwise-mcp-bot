Splitwise is a popular expense-sharing app that helps people split bills and track shared expenses. This MCP server provides tools to:

- Manage user profiles and account settings
- Create and manage groups for shared expenses (e.g., roommates, trips, couples)
- Add and manage friends for individual expense sharing
- Create, update, and delete expenses with various splitting options
- Add comments to expenses for better communication
- Get notifications about account activity
- Retrieve supported currencies and expense categories

The API uses a personal access token for authentication and supports both equal splits and custom share-based expense splitting."""
